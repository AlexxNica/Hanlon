# This is the superclass for all database object types
# there are database object types for each possible database that can back Razor
# common functions are created here to handle accessors and key/values
# Child object types override when needed for specific type
# All keys are assumed to be simple string and all values are assumed to be YAML string

# This adds Razor Common lib path to the load path for this child proc
