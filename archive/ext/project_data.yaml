summary: flexible discovery and provisioning solution for bare metal and virtual machines
description: |
  Hanlon is a full-stack solution for managing the full bare metal and
  virtual machine lifecycle, designed to scale from small deployments
  to clusters of hundreds of thousands of physical machines.
  
  It melds together dynamic discovery of machine properties, simple models
  of current and desired state, and a flexible policy engine to easily
  express configuration for networks at any scale.
  
  Hanlon also focuses beyond the simple "OS installation" scenario, and is
  designed to enable complex models such as "upgrade firmware, then install",
  or "decommission, securely wipe disks, rediscover, and reprovision".
  
  Unlike many tools, Hanlon focuses on doing one job extremely well, and
  handling on responsibility.  Once the basic configuration is done, Hanlon
  will hand the system to a configuration management broker like Puppet
  to provide ongoing change management - or it can simple stop, hands off,
  for manual management.
  
  It also focuses heavily on providing extension points and hooks to allow
  you to model your needs.  It is deliberately agnostic to platform, OS,
  and configuration broker choices.
