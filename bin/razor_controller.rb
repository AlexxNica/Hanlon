# starting and stopping the Node.js instances when it is started and stopped
# and also responsible for ensuring that these Node.js instances and the
# underlying (mongodb for now) database instance remain running while this
# script is running.  The database instance is assumed to be started and
# stopped remotely, this script only ensures that it remains running while
# the Razor server (i.e. the Node.js instances) are running
